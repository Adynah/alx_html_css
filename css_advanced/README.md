SmileSchool – Advanced CSS Project
This is part of my CSS walkthrough task, where the goal was to bring a given Figma design to life using semantic HTML and custom CSS. The focus was mainly on structure, layout, styling, and responsiveness.

Objective
The purpose of this task was to practice writing clean, scalable CSS by recreating a provided landing page design. I used an already built HTML structure and focused solely on styling it to match the Figma reference as closely as possible.

Tools Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Figma (for layout specs and design details)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- VS Code

Sections Styled
- Header / Navigation – Flex layout with logo and menu items
- Hero Section – Headline, subheadings, and CTA button
- Instructor Profiles – Reusable card layout with images and descriptions
- Testimonial Section – Two-column layout with image and quote
- Tutorials – Grid layout with image, description, star ratings, and time
- Free Membership – Icons with supporting text
- FAQ Section – Structured for possible accordion logic 
- Footer – Logo and social media icons centered with copyright

What I Focused On
- Getting consistent spacing and alignment using Flexbox
- Keeping my CSS clean and organized with comments per section
- Making the layout responsive for smaller screens
- Following typography and color codes from the Figma design
- Using Font Awesome icons where applicable (stars, socials)

What I Learned
- How to inspect and match Figma layout properties (spacing, padding, color, font)
- Structuring CSS for better readability and reuse
- Handling layouts with nested Flex and Grid
- Paying attention to design detail
